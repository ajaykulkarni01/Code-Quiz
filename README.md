# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For this project, I've developed a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. This is fully responsive app with clean and polished user interface.

I was presented with the following acceptance criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
